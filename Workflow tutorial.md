# Generic Project Workflow Tutorial

## 1. Project Setup

- **Create main repository**: minimal, empty façade to start.
- **Create separate repositories** for each independent feature or component.
- **Establish standards**:
  - Testing required for every component
  - Consistent code style
  - README or documentation for each repository

---

## 2. Component Development

- **Develop each component independently**.
- **Test thoroughly** each function or unit immediately after creation.
- **Keep components generic and reusable** → usable across multiple projects.
- **Limit file complexity** → e.g., 5 functions/classes per file.
- Optional: experimental components can be developed separately without touching the stable system.

---

## 3. Integration

- Gradually **integrate components into the main repository**.
- Run **tests before integration** to catch regressions.
- Maintain **plug-and-play architecture**:
  - Components interact via clearly defined interfaces
  - Avoid hidden dependencies or spaghetti connections

---

## 4. Review & Maintenance

- Main repository = final product.
- Tests ensure stability and correctness at all times.
- Team members can safely work on individual components.
- Stable core remains untouched → experimental work does not break the main system.

---

## 5. Reusability & Future Projects

- Components = **fully reusable** for other projects.
- Can be integrated into any new project → maintains plug-and-play and test guarantees.
- Experimental components = optional additions for future growth.

---

## 6. Optional Tips

- Keep some repositories “hidden” for stealth development → main repo remains clean until ready.
- Incremental integration → **maximum clarity and control**.
- Independent, tested, reusable components = **professional workflow that scales efficiently**.

*Outcome:*  
A clean, professional, modular, plug-and-play system. Stable, scalable, reusable, and easy for the team to maintain, regardless of programming language or project type.
