# UML Association Cheat Sheet

An association is a structural relationship between two classes.
It means objects of one class are connected to objects of another.

## ðŸ”¹ Association Basics

- Plain line (`--`) â†’ bidirectional by default.
- Arrow (`-->`) â†’ unidirectional (navigability: one class knows about the other).
- Two arrows (`<-->`) â†’ explicitly bidirectional (same as plain line, but less common).

## ðŸ”¹ Types of Associations
### 1. Unidirectional Association

Only one class knows about the other.
```
classDiagram
    Teacher --> Student : teaches
```

âœ… Meaning: Teacher has a reference to Student, but Student does not know Teacher.

---
### 2. Bidirectional Association

Both classes know about each other.
```
classDiagram
    Teacher -- Student : works with
```

âœ… Meaning: Teacher has a reference to Student, and Student also knows Teacher.

---
### 3. Explicit Bidirectional (<-->)

Same as plain line, but arrows make it explicit.
```
classDiagram
    Teacher <--> Student
```

âœ… Same meaning as above. Usually redundant.

## ðŸ”¹ Multiplicity in Associations

- `1` â†’ Exactly one
- `0..1` â†’ Zero or one (optional)
- `*` or `0..*` â†’ Zero or many
- `1..*` â†’ At least one
- `n` â†’ Exactly n
- `n..m` â†’ Between n and m

Example:
```
classDiagram
    Teacher "1" --> "*" Student : teaches
```


âœ… Meaning: One teacher teaches many students, and each student has one teacher.

---
## ðŸ”¹ Association vs Dependency

- Association â†’ a long-term structural link (usually stored as an attribute).
- Dependency (dashed arrow) â†’ a short-term usage (like passing an object to a method).

Example:
```
classDiagram
    Teacher --> Student : has
    Teacher ..> Chalk : uses
```

âœ… Teacher permanently knows Students (association).
âœ… Teacher temporarily uses Chalk (dependency).

## ðŸ”¹ Association in Different Diagrams

- **Class Diagram** â†’ solid line (with/without arrow).
- **Object Diagram** â†’ same, but between specific instances.
- **Use Case Diagram** â†’ actor linked to use case.
- **Sequence Diagram** â†’ implied through messages, not drawn as a line.

## âœ¨ Quick Summary

- `--` = bidirectional association (default).
- `-->` = unidirectional (navigable).
- `<-->` = explicit bidirectional (same as plain line).
- **Add multiplicity** for "how many" objects are linked.
- Remember: association = "has a reference to."
