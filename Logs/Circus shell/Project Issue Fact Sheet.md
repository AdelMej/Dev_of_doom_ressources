1. Targeted Criticism & Unfair Treatment

You received all criticism; Malik received none.

Actions by the SWE (Hugo) and CEO contributed to this imbalance.

Evidence: Tuesday meeting & forced deletion of prep materials.

2. Disruption of Communication

Deletion of prep led Malik to stop cooperating and communicating.

Multiple disruptions prevented you from addressing issues in real time.

Repeated interruptions during meetings silenced your concerns.

3. Protection of Malik

CEO actions shielded Malik from accountability.

Malik admitted to unprofessional behavior but faced no consequences.

4. Preparedness & Workflow

Trello board used to structure the project step by step.

Malik’s failure to follow or protect prep caused extra workload.

Prep made 3-day shell completion feasible; planning was effective.

5. Forced Integration Work

You had to integrate Malik’s work due to his failure to meet standards.

This added stress and directly impacted project progress.

6. Mental Health & Personal Impact

Situation caused stress, anxiety, and trauma.

Social anxiety worsened due to repeated silencing and unfair treatment.

7. Accountability & Closure

Only you assumed responsibility; others avoided it.

Attempts at discussion were blocked; no meaningful closure achieved.

8. Overall Assessment

Targeted attacks, lack of accountability, repeated silencing, and unprofessional behavior created a toxic and unfair environment.

Proper communication, accountability, and professional standards could have prevented this chain of events.
