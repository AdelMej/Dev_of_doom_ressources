## 💥 Project Timeline
- **Day 1–2:** 🛠️ Somewhat functional shell  
- **Day 3:** 💥 Disaster, project nuked

A minimal shell implemented in C. Only basic command execution. Educational project.

### Features

- Basic argument parsing  
- Exit with `exit` command  

> ⚠️ No piping, redirection, or advanced features. Error handling is minimal. Works on Linux (tested on Ubuntu 20.04).
