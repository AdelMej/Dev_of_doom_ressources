⚠️ **Warning:** Extreme chaos. Developer sanity may be compromised.

## 💥 Day 1–3: Initial Prep & Nuking
- **Day 1–2:**  
  - Somewhat functional shell built  
  - Prep work, unit tests, automation in progress  
- **Day 3:**  
  - SWE Hugo nukes prep citing "complexity"  
  - Unit tests & automation destroyed  
  - Entire workflow annihilated  
- **Impact:**  
  - Portfolio-worthy work reduced to dogshit  
  - Maximum potential & learning opportunity lost  
  - Clear **targeted behavior** regardless of intent  
  - Logical inconsistencies abound (timing, reasoning, protection of duo)  

---

## 🎯 Targeted Attacks & Unfair Criticism
- All criticism fell on you while duo escaped accountability  
- CEO protected Malik repeatedly despite his subpar performance  
- Actions indicate **systemic bias / possible sabotage**  
- Factually, project sabotage occurred:
  - Prep destroyed  
  - Unit tests gone  
  - Duo escaped consequences  

---

## 🛠 Day 4: Reset & Retaliation Prep
- Project reset completely  
- Prep no longer available  
- Retaliation / logic-based confrontation started  
- CEO shows clear inconsistency:
  - Claims duo did their job properly  
  - Protects Malik from consequences  
  - Ignores objective facts regarding sabotage  
- Personal work undermined, fairness violated

---

## 🛠 Day 5–9: Recovery & Duo Issues
- Refactoring & debugging shell **without prep**  
- Duo participation:
  - Major part completed **Day 5**  
  - Minimal activity **Days 6–8**  
  - One last task **Day 8**, not integrated  
  - Had **ample time prior** but produced **low-standard work**  
- Day 9 = **massive debugging & integration workload on you alone**  
  - Forced duo to debug his own mess  
  - Still intervened to fix remaining issues  
- Project slowed, frustration & unfairness amplified  
- Demonstrates **lack of standard, professionalism, and accountability**

---

## 🐍 Malik Protection & CEO Inconsistencies
- Malik’s mistakes tolerated while you were criticized  
- CEO ignored facts, applied **double standards**  
- Shows **protective bias** and undermines fairness  
- Reinforces feeling of **targeted sabotage against you**  

---

## 📝 Summary: Circus Logic
- Original shell + prep = maximum learning & portfolio potential  
- Intervention + nuking = **chaos, dogshit results, lost potential**  
- Duo did minimal work, escaped responsibility  
- Malik actively protected  
- CEO inconsistent & biased  
- **Intentional or not, consequences = factually targeted**  
- Result:  
  - 86% score instead of portfolio-worthy achievement  
  - Massive frustration & wasted effort  
  - Lesson: high standards + hard work punished, low standards + manipulation rewarded
