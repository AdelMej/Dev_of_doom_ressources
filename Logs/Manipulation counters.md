# 🛡️ Counter-Narc Playbook

## 1. Establish Continuity (Timeline Lock)
- Keep events in order: **date + fact**.  
- Removes their ability to rewrite history.  
- ✅ Example:  
  - `2025-03-02 – Malik left pairing session without warning.`

---

## 2. Document Expectations (Cause → Effect Lock)
- Write **Expected vs. Actual**.  
- Exposes the gap clearly.  
- ✅ Example:  
  - **Expected:** Equal contribution.  
  - **Actual:** Malik bailed mid-way.

---

## 3. Neutral Tone, Nuclear Effect
- State facts like a **bug report**, not an emotional rant.  
- Starves them of “you’re angry/unreasonable” ammo.  

---

## 4. Mirror Without Emotion
- Reflect their claims back with **receipts**.  
- ✅ Example:  
  - **Claim:** “You disrespected his pace.”  
  - **Counter:** “I asked him to explain the code, and he did so correctly, showing he understood.”

---

## 5. Archive the Evidence
- Emails, chat logs, git history, screenshots.  
- You = infinite memory.  
- Them = short memory.

---

## 6. Don’t Chase, Let Them Cook
- Drop timeline + receipts.  
- Stay silent.  
- They either overreact (dig hole deeper) or shut up. Both = win.

---

## ⚡ Formula Recap
**Timeline Lock + Cause/Effect Lock + Neutral Delivery + Archival = Narc Countermeta**
