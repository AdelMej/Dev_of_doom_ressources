# DaMini Dev Universe — Project Recap

This is a summary of the DaMini projects — a collection of automated, modular, and plug-and-play tools designed to make development, deployment, and monitoring effortless. GG no re.

---

## 1. Auto-Flask
**Purpose:** Rapid backend setup for Flask apps.
**Highlights:**
- One-command backend deployment (`bash install.sh`)
- JWT auth, CORS, and database (SQLAlchemy) preconfigured
- Prebuilt folder structure for routes, models, and services
- Systemd service + Nginx config for production
- Optional environment-aware deploy scripts

**Why it’s important:** Foundation of the dev stack — instant backend without wasting hours on setup.

---

## 2. DaMiniSCSS
**Purpose:** Modular SCSS architecture for frontend styling.
**Highlights:**
- Prebuilt folder structure (`base/`, `components/`, `layout/`)
- Variables and mixins for colors, grids, and responsiveness
- Dark/light theme support
- Auto-compile and minify pipeline

**Why it’s important:** Makes frontend styling effortless and consistent across projects.

## 3. DaMiniGodSquad
**Purpose:** Full observability and monitoring stack.
**Highlights:**
- Prometheus, Node Exporter, Loki, Promtail, Grafana
- Preconfigured dashboards and alerts
- Single-command deployment
- Monitors CPU, RAM, network, services, and application logs

**Why it’s important:** Replaces traditional dashboard development — everything is already monitored.

---

## 4. Auto-JEE
**Purpose:** Automated enterprise backend setup.
**Highlights:**
- Preconfigured WildFly/Tomcat servers
- JDBC + Hibernate setup
- Prebuilt enterprise routes and JWT filters
- Integrated with DaMiniGodSquad for monitoring
- One-command deploy for production

**Why it’s important:** Extends automation to enterprise-grade Java apps — fast prototyping and deployment.

---

## 5. DaMiniSkynet
**Purpose:** AI from scratch in C using a plug-and-play design.
**Highlights:**
- Custom tensor and autograd engine
- PnP modules: load/unload layers, optimizers, and losses at runtime
- Training loops, matrix operations, and backpropagation from scratch
- Console output with adaptive learning metrics

**Why it’s important:** Experimental AI platform — modular, low-level, and totally insane.

---

## 6. DaMiniEngine
**Purpose:** Pure C modular game engine.
**Highlights:**
- PnP module system for graphics, physics, audio, and AI
- Hot-swappable systems at runtime
- Asset compilation and map editor tools
- Full modularity: swap renderers, physics engines, or AI mid-game

**Why it’s important:** Modular game engine designed for experimentation, performance, and chaos energy.

## TL;DR
- **Auto-Flask:** Backend spawner
- **DaMiniSCSS:** Frontend styling magic
- **DaMiniGodSquad:** Monitoring god-tier
- **Auto-JEE:** Enterprise backend automation
- **DaMiniSkynet:** AI in C madness
- **DaMiniEngine:** Modular pure C game engine

Together, these projects form the **DaMini Dev Universe** — a plug-and-play, automated, and modular development ecosystem. GG no re.
