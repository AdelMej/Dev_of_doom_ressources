# Echo Chamber Protocol - Proof of Concept Roadmap

## Step 1: Core Course Engine
- Implement course structure with **beginner → intermediate → boss** levels
- Example topics for coding: if/else, loops, functions
- Each course provides **straightforward, no-fluff docs**
- Course flow:
  - Run course
  - Fail → learn and retry
  - Ego reaches zero → reset / wait for next day
  - Beat boss → unlock next course

## Step 2: Turbocharge & Ego Mechanics
- **Turbocharge mode** activated on multiple attempts/failures
- XP gained per failure (encourages experimentation)
- Limits:
  - Max 100 failures per session for turbocharge
  - 5 failures in 60 seconds → ego death
- Ego health bar tracks mental state
- Failure encouraged; learning through repeated attempts

## Step 3: Boss Fights
- Boss = advanced project or challenging exercise
- Unlimited attempts allowed
- Failure condition only through **inactivity** or ego collapse
- Completion unlocks next course

## Step 4: Failure Tracking & XP Logging
- Track each session’s:
  - Number of failures
  - XP gained (max failures count)
  - Time spent
- Provide metrics for self-assessment
- Optional leaderboard for personal progress, not competition

## Step 5: Portfolio / Mastery Projects
- After finishing a course, optional **portfolio project**
- Projects test mastery of all course concepts
- Provides tangible output for learning validation
- Encourages creative application rather than rote practice

## Optional Future Features
- Music intensifies in turbocharge mode for immersion
- Expand courses to:
  - Math → Physics → Chemistry → Coding
- Adaptable for different age groups (adults first, then children)
- Progress saved locally (no account needed)

**Goal:** Maximize learning efficiency, resilience, and skill mastery through **repeated failure and reflection** — all in a solo, ego-driven “game-like” environment.
