# Echo Chamber Protocol â€“ Coding Edition

## Overview
The Echo Chamber Protocol is a solo, rogue-like learning experience where **your ego is the enemy**. Fail, iterate, and turbocharge your skills while battling your own limits. XP is gained through failure and mastery.  

---

## Game Mechanics
- **Ego Bar**: Tracks sanity/mental stability.  
  - Failure = ego loss  
  - Turbocharge mode = temporary immunity & XP boost  
- **XP**: Counts failures; higher XP = more experience gained  
- **Turbocharge**: Activated after consistent learning; boosts learning speed, prevents ego collapse temporarily  
- **Course Run**: Reset occurs at ego zero or inactivity; completion unlocks next course  
- **Boss Fights**: Unlimited attempts; only inactivity can cause reset

## Course Structure (Language: Python)

### Beginner
- **Concepts**: Variables, basic loops, conditions
- **Challenges**:
  1. Write a `for` loop to sum numbers 1-10
  2. Write an `if/else` check for even/odd numbers
- **Boss**: Create a small calculator class (input + output)  
- **Failure Encouraged**: Each failed attempt = +XP  

### Intermediate
- **Concepts**: Functions, recursion, lists, dictionaries
- **Challenges**:
  1. Write a function to reverse a list
  2. Solve factorial using recursion
  3. Create a dictionary to store and retrieve user scores
- **Boss**: Build a small text-based game using functions
- **Turbocharge Limit**: 100 fails per session; 5 fails per minute = ego death  

### Expert
- **Concepts**: OOP, error handling, file I/O
- **Challenges**:
  1. Create a class hierarchy for a library system
  2. Handle invalid file inputs
  3. Read/write user data to a file safely
- **Boss**: Build a mini project simulating a library system with multiple users and books
- **Ego Mechanic**: Failure during the boss = XP gain but no ego loss  

---

## Progression
- Completing a boss unlocks the next language or course module  
- Documentation for each concept is **straightforward, no fluff**  
- Each day you loop through exercises reinforces skill retention  

---

## Optional Mechanics
- **Failure Streaks**: Spamming failure intelligently = turbocharge mode  
- **Portfolio Projects**: After course completion, optional projects to solidify mastery  
- **Meta Stats**: Track failures, turbocharges, time taken

> Remember: The goal is learning, not competition. Ego death is a tool, not a punishment.
