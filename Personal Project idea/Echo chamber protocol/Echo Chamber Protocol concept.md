# Echo Chamber Protocol 🎭

A roguelike-style coding course where failure = progress.  
Your ego bar is your health, and XP comes from failing forward.

---

## Core Loop
1. Pick a **Course** (e.g., If/Else).
2. Complete **Beginner → Intermediate → Boss** stages.
3. Gain XP from failures.
4. Reset if:
   - Ego Bar = 0 (Ego Death 💀).
   - Inactivity (1+ day without progress).
5. Beat the **Boss** to unlock the next course.

---

## Ego Bar 🧠
- Depletes on failures.
- Resets to full when completing a course.
- If Ego = 0 → **Ego Death** → run reset → wait 1 day.

---

## XP System 📈
- **Normal Fail**: +1 XP
- **Turbocharged Fail**: +2 XP
- **Abuse Check**:  
  - >5 fails in <60s = Turbocharge cancelled  
  - Ego Bar drops massively  
  - Session XP reset to 0  

XP = total failures in a run (max failures = max XP).

---

## Turbocharge ⚡
- Activates after consistent fast failing.
- Grants failure immunity (no ego loss).
- Ends after **100 fails**.  
- Cannot be brute-forced (abuse check applies).  
- Encouraged strategy = **fail fast, think faster**.

---

## Boss Rules 👑
- Unlimited attempts.
- No turbocharge fail cap.  
- Only failure condition = inactivity reset.  
- Beat the boss = course cleared.

---

## Learning Resources 📚
- Each course has straight-to-the-point docs.
- No fluff: only what you need to know.
- Fail → read → retry → level up.

---

## Philosophy 🌀
- Failure is encouraged.  
- Brute force is punished.  
- Resilience = power.  
- Ego Death = not the end, but a cooldown.
