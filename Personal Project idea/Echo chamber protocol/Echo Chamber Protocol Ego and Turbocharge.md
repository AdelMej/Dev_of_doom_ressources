# Echo Chamber Protocol: Ego & Turbocharge Flow

## Ego Bar
- **100% Ego** → Normal learning pace
- **50-20% Ego** → Warning: High failure rate, turbocharge incoming
- **0% Ego** → Ego collapse, forced cooldown (cannot continue until next day)

## Turbocharge Mode
- Activated automatically when Ego < 20%
- Failures now grant **XP instead of penalty**
- Maximum turbocharge lasts **100 fails per session**
- Boss levels: unlimited attempts, inactivity reset only
- Encouraged strategy: fail fast, learn faster
- Turbocharge limit prevents abuse: 5 fails per 60 seconds triggers **instant ego collapse**

## Learning Flow
1. Attempt exercise
2. Fail → Ego decreases
3. Ego < 20% → Turbocharge activated
4. Failures now = XP
5. Complete exercise → Ego partially restored
6. Boss fight → unlimited fails, only inactivity can stop run
7. Complete course → Unlock next course
