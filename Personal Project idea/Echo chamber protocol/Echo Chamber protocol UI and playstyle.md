# ⚡ Echo Chamber Protocol  
*A rogue-like coding grind where failure = XP.*  

---

## 🎮 Core Mechanics  
- **Ego Bar** → Health meter. Drops on failure.  
- **XP Counter** → Gained from failures. More fails = more XP.  
- **Turbocharge** → Activates after streaks of failures without ego death. Grants *failure immunity*.  
- **Ego Death** → 5 fails in 60s = instant reset. Session XP = lost.  
- **Boss Challenges** → No attempt limit. Failures cost minimal ego.
